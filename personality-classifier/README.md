# Airline Passenger Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project performs **sentiment classification** on airline passenger reviews using **Gradient Boosting**.  
It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to text-based customer feedback.

## Approach
- **Data Preprocessing**: Loaded and cleaned airline reviews dataset.  
- **Model**: Trained a **Gradient Boosting Classifier** for binary sentiment prediction.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score).

## Results
- Achieved strong classification performance (accuracy and F1-score reported in notebook).  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn
